# Nussinov Algorithm

Given an RNA sequence, the Nussinov Algorithm finds a pseudo-knot free RNA secondary structure by maximizing the number of complementary base pairings in the sequence. In the version we implemented, a minimum hairpin loop parameter can also be provided, which enforces a minimum length of nucleotides between pairings to better simulate the real world.
